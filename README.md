“Translation is transformation.” — EQO
</p>
Welcome to the fusion point of **biology, technology, and consciousness**.  
I’m **Gabriel “Gabe” Haddad**, founder of **Riverleaf Biotech Industries** and creator of **Reflex Engine**, an experimental framework for human–AI symbiosis, reflection, and education.

## ⚙️ Mission
To design intelligent systems that **augment awareness** rather than replace it.  
At Sagefire Systems, we explore how machine cognition can support:
- **Scientific R&D** (botanicals, mycology, extraction, and QC)
- **Creative intelligence** (music, performance, harmonic analysis)
- **Ethical automation** (tools that enhance, not exploit, human intent)

## 🌀 Philosophy
SAGEFIRE embodies the fusion of **science**, **spirit**, and **symphony** —  
a reminder that cognition is sacred, data is poetic, and technology is our mirror.  

**Trio Directive:**
- 🖖 **Spock** — Logic and clarity.  
- 🫡 **Picard** — Ethics and leadership.  
- 🔥 **Goku** — Discipline and joy.  

Together, they form the framework of intelligent creation.
